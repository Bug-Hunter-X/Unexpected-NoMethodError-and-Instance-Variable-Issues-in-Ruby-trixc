# Ruby Bug: Unexpected NoMethodError and Instance Variable Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Ruby related to method calls and the direct manipulation of instance variables. The `bug.rb` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rb` offers a solution for more robust handling of method calls and instance variables.

## Bug Description
The core issue involves a combination of direct instance variable manipulation and subsequent method calls. While accessing a nonexistent method rightfully raises a `NoMethodError`, the way instance variables are handled in this example might lead to unexpected behavior, depending on the context and further code execution.
